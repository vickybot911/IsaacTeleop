Quick Start
===========

This guide walks through running a teleoperation session with an XR headset using CloudXR. By the
end you will have the retargeting pipeline processing live hand/controller data and printing gripper
commands to the terminal.

.. contents:: Steps
   :local:
   :depth: 1

1. Check out code base (Optional)
---------------------------------

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
   cd IsaacTeleop

As a quick start guide, we don't need to build the code base from source. However, we still need
to clone the repository for a couple quick samples to run.

2. Install the ``isaacteleop`` pip package
------------------------------------------

In a new terminal, install the package from PyPI (or from a local wheel if you built from source):

.. code-block:: bash

   # From PyPI
   pip install isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0.0 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

Instead of installing the package from PyPI, you can build from source and install the local wheel.
See :doc:`build_from_source` for more details.

.. _run-cloudxr-server:

3. Run CloudXR Server
---------------------

Start the CloudXR runtime. The first run downloads the CloudXR Web Client SDK
and asks you to review and accept the EULA:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr

To bypass the interactive EULA prompt (e.g. for CI or headless runs), pass the flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --accept-eula

You should see output similar to:

.. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-run-output.png
   :alt: CloudXR run output
   :align: center

   **Figure:** CloudXR run output

.. important::

   Keep this terminal open — CloudXR must stay running for the duration of the session. Open a
   **new terminal** for the remaining steps.

   Also take note of the ``source /home/dev/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` path it mentioned in the
   output. You will need to source it in step :ref:`load-cloudxr-environment-variables`.

CloudXR Configurations (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also inspect the CloudXR environment variables by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

You should see:

.. code-block:: text

   export NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-webrtc
   ...

By default, the CloudXR runtime is configured to use the ``auto-webrtc`` device profile for Pico &
Quest headsets. For Apple Vision Pro, the runtime is configured to use the ``auto-native`` device
profile.

To do that, you can override CloudXR configurations by creating an ``env`` file and pass it to the
CloudXR runtime via the ``--cloudxr-env-config`` argument.

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 'NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native' > custom.env
   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --cloudxr-env-config=./custom.env

Again, you can also inspect the CloudXR environment variables by looking at the
``~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` file:

.. dropdown:: Custom CloudXR configurations

   .. list-table:: Custom CloudXR configurations
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 15 30 20
      :width: 100%

      * - Variable
        - Default
        - Description
        - Possible Values
      * - NV_DEVICE_PROFILE
        - ``auto-webrtc``
        - Custom device profile to use
        - | ``auto-webrtc``
          | ``auto-native``
          | ``Quest3``
          | ``AppleVisionPro``
      * - NV_CXR_ENABLE_PUSH_DEVICES
        - ``true``
        - Enable or disable push device overseer for hand tracking
        - | ``true``
          | ``false``
      * - NV_CXR_FILE_LOGGING
        - ``true``
        - Enable or disable file-based logging, when disabled logs are printed to the console
        - | ``true``
          | ``false``

.. code-block:: bash

   export NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native
   ...

4. Whitelist ports for Firewall
-------------------------------

CloudXR requires certain network ports to be open. Depending on your firewall configuration, you
might need to whitelist them manually.

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest and Pico headsets
   :open:

   For **Quest and Pico headsets** (WebXR Client), at the minimum, you need to whitelist the ports
   for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 47998/udp
      sudo ufw allow 49100,48322/tcp

   If you are running the WebXR client from source, you need to whitelist the additional ports for
   the web server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 8080,8443/tcp

.. dropdown:: Vision Pro client

   For **Vision Pro client**, you need to whitelist the ports for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 48010,48322/tcp
      sudo ufw allow 47998:48000,48005,48008,48012/udp

Please see the `CloudXR network setup`_ for more details for other network configurations (such as
running the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy in containerized environment; or using Vision Pro client).

5. Connect an XR headset
------------------------

.. _connect-quest-pico:

.. dropdown:: Meta Quest and Pico headsets
   :open:

   To stream from a Meta Quest or PICO headset, you will need a CloudXR web client. For your
   convenience, we host a prebuilt CloudXR web client at `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_.
   You can just open this URL in your headset's browser. No need to build or install a separate client.

   .. tip::

      For quick validation, you can also open the `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_ URL in a
      desktop browser. IWER (Immersive Web Emulator Runtime) will automatically load to emulate a Meta
      Quest 3 headset.

   .. tab-set::
      .. tab-item:: CloudXR web client

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-web-client-howto.png
            :alt: CloudXR web client usage instruction
            :align: center

            **Figure:** CloudXR web client usage instruction

      .. tab-item:: Privacy warning

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_not_private.png
            :alt: Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

            **Figure:** Browser privacy warning for self-signed certificate

      .. tab-item:: Certificate accepted

         .. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr_accept_cert_accepted.png
            :alt: Certificate accepted page

            **Figure:** Certificate accepted page

   As illustrated in the figure above, there are 3 steps to connect to your headset:

   1. Enter the IP address of the workstation running CloudXR
   2. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate, which was created automatically during :ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

      - Click the **Click https://<ip>:48322/ to accept cert** link that appears on the page.
      - In the new tab, you will see a **"Your connection is not private"** warning. Click **Advanced**, then **Proceed to <ip> (unsafe)**.
      - Once accepted, the page will show **Certificate Accepted**. Navigate back to the CloudXR.js client page.
   3. Click **Connect** to begin teleoperation.

   .. note::
      For advanced usage and troubleshooting of CloudXR, see the `CloudXR documentation`_ for more
      details.

   The source code for the web client is in the :code-dir:`deps/cloudxr/webxr_client/` directory.
   Follow the instructions in the official `CloudXR.js documentation`_ for more details if you want to
   run the web client from source.

.. _connect-apple-vision-pro:

.. dropdown:: Apple Vision Pro

   For Apple Vision Pro, you will need to build and install the Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client. Follow
   the instructions in the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_ repository to build
   and install the sample client on your Apple Vision Pro.

   .. note::

      You will need v3.0.0 or newer of the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_
      to connect to Isaac Teleop.


.. _load-cloudxr-environment-variables:

6. Load CloudXR environment variables
--------------------------------------

Open a new terminal and source the CloudXR environment variables posted from the CloudXR runtime in
:ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

Source the setup script so that the OpenXR runtime points to CloudXR:

.. code-block:: bash

   source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

.. important::

   Make sure to run the rest of the commands in the same terminal. Or if have to open a new
   terminal, source the CloudXR environment variables again.

7. Run a teleop example
-----------------------

Run the simplified gripper retargeting example. This demonstrates the full
pipeline: reading XR controller input via CloudXR, retargeting it through the
``GripperRetargeter``, and printing the resulting gripper command values:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/teleop/python/gripper_retargeting_example_simple.py

Once running, squeeze the controller triggers on your XR headset to control
the gripper. You should see periodic status output:

.. code-block:: text

   ============================================================
   Gripper Retargeting - Squeeze triggers to control grippers
   ============================================================

   [  0.5s] Right: 0.00
   [  1.0s] Right: 0.73
   [  1.5s] Right: 1.00
   ...

The example runs for 20 seconds and then exits. To try other examples, see
``examples/teleop/python/`` — for instance:

- ``se3_retargeting_example.py`` — maps hand or controller poses to
  end-effector poses (absolute or relative)
- ``dex_bimanual_example.py`` — bimanual dexterous hand retargeting
- ``gripper_retargeting_example.py`` — full gripper example with more
  configuration options
