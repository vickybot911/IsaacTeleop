**Isaac Teleop** (`GitHub repo <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop>`_) is the unified framework for high-fidelity
egocentric and robot data collection. It provides a standardized device interface, a flexible
graph-based retargeting pipeline, and a streamlined data collection workflow
that work seamlessly across simulated and real-world robots.

Key features:

- **Unified stack** for sim and real teleoperation (ROS2, Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab)
- **Standardized device interface** for XR headsets, gloves, foot pedals, body trackers
- **Flexible retargeting** to different robot embodiments
- **Plugin system** for adding new devices and use cases

.. tip::

   **Just want to get running?** Follow the :doc:`getting_started/quick_start` how-to guide for
   installation and first-run steps.
